    <p>This page is about letting the user look at some of the data statistics
      such as find the mean in some data or some other basic statistics. Yes,
      compared to the graph page, this page me be quite boring. So, if you want
      to see some excitement head on over to the graph page. Other than that,
      I'll put some photo's on this page to help liven it up.
