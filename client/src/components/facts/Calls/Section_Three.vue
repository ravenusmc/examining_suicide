        This Third section is where things start to change. I turn my focus to
        looking at the U.S and suicide statistics within that country. Yes, I'm
        from the U.S. so I think its a country that I want to focus on. The above
        sections where meant to get some quick facts about statistics in certain
        countries. Here, we zoom in on the U.S. and try to find some basic information
        like the mean, etc. On the graphs page is where a lot of the data will be
        turned into graphs. As I said earlier, the U.S data goes from 1979 to
        2016. One thing, that I did not look at above, was that the data is broken
        up by age group. That's something that I be looking at here as well. The
        age groups are the following: 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-54, 55-74, 75+. Let's
        get started!
