# Examining_Suicide
## Intro

This project will examine suicides around the world. It's built using Python's web
framework Flaks for the backend and the front end is built in Vue 2. The link,
for the dataset, is below:

As usual, the dataset comes from Kaggle. Furthermore, the guide at testdriven.io
helped me at times throughout this project since this is really my first project
working with both flask and Vue together.
